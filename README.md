# GPU Programming Approaches

This repository collects material for the full-day workshop *GPU Programming Approaches*.

## Sections

The tutorial starts with an [introductory presentation](./material/introduction-to-gpu-programming-techniques.pdf) with the following content:
* Basics of GPU architecture
* GPU programming on an abstract level
* Popular approaches to GPU programming

It is followed by more technical content on:
* [Data Handling](./material/data-handling.ipynb)
  * How to allocate and move data
* [Parallel Computation](./material/parallel-computation.ipynb)
  * How to launch threads on the GPU
  * How to map between work to be done and parallel threads
* [next steps](./material/next-steps.ipynb)
  * Further considerations for choosing between GPU programming approaches
  * Basics of performance evaluation
  * Reductions on GPUs

At this point, the tutorial is interleaved with separate, more in-depth programming tutorials.

The workshop concludes with multi-leveled a [programming challenge](./material/programming-challenge.ipynb).
